This is the second release of the project. It's made up of several parts:
- a DAC board equipped with an STM32L432 nucleo board and 16 channel 12 bit AD5391 DAC.
- separate boards containing analog modules: VCO's, mixers (including the VCA), VCF, output stage.

With respect to version 1, the new DAC board is far smaller and the STM32 code has been optimized by using DMA transfer everywhere.
In particular, UART based printf() is now fully functional.
